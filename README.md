# sd-webui-inpaint-difference
## Overview
An A1111 extension to add a new operation mode in the `img2img` tab. It finds a background mask using rembg.  

## WIP
This project is stalled for now. Adding img2img tabs in the webui is difficult to do in a scalable fashion, so we're addressing that first.  
The repo will come back to life in a couple of weeks when we figure out how to maintain efficiently extensions that require unusual hacks to function.  
  
Thanks for your understanding!
